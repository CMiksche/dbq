dbq - Barbeque the boiler plate code [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq) [![cover.run](https://cover.run/go/github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq.svg?style=flat&tag=golang-1.12)](https://cover.run/go?tag=golang-1.12&repo=github.com%2Frocketlaunchr%2Fdbq) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq)
===============

Everyone knows that performing simple queries in Go takes numerous lines of code that is often repetitive. If you want to avoid the clutter, you have two options: A heavy-duty ORM that is not up to the standard of Laraval or Django. Or DBQ!


## What is included

* Supports ANY type of query
* **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** compatible
* **Convenient** and **Developer Friendly**
* Bulk Insert seamlessly
* Unmarshal query results directly to struct using [mapstructure](https://github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure) package
* Super lightweight
* Compatible with [mysql-go](https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go) for proper MySQL cancelation

## Dependencies

* [MySQL driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) OR
* [PostgreSQL driver](https://github.com/lib/pq)


## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq
```


## Examples

### Address Operator

The Address Operator allows you to use more visually pleasing syntax. There is no need for a temporary variable. It can be used with `string`, `bool`, `int`, `float64` and function calls where the function returns 1 return value.


```go

func main() {

	message := &"igo is so convenient"
	display(message)
   
	display(&`inline string`)

	display(&defaultMessage())

}

func display(m *string) {
	if m == nil {
		fmt.Print("no message")
	} else {
		fmt.Print(*m)
	}

}

func defaultMessage() string {
	return "default message"
}

```

### Fordefer

See [Blog post](https://blog.learngoprogramming.com/gotchas-of-defer-in-go-1-8d070894cb01) on why this is an improvement. It can be especially helpful in unit tests.

```go

for {
	row, err := db.Query("SELECT ...")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fordefer row.Close()
}

```


### Defer go

This feature makes Go's language syntax more internally consistent. There is no reason why `defer` and `go` should not work together.

```go

mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	start := time.Now()
	// Transmit how long the request took to serve without delaying response to client.
	defer go transmitRequestStats(start)

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the home page!")
})

```
